# Scraping-for-Treasure-
I, Kathryn, am messing around with web scraping. 

My friend's birthday is in August, I would like to get this cool Halo shirt, but their size is not in stock. ðŸ¥² So I am making a web scraper using Python and Beautifulsoup that should email me when it is in stock. From there we can only hope it becomes available!

Join me as I navigate the tags of Urban Outfitters in search of the holy Halo Combat Evolved Anniversary Shirt because apparently real vintage ones are like $200 and I am still a mere engineering student.
